    When wakeboarding, you might have a break once in a while. Which aspects
    should you keep in mind for your safety when taking a break?

    <h6>After a break, don't forget to put your helmet and life vest back on.</h6>
    <p>
      After a break, it is very common to forget to put your helmet back on and
      continue riding obstacles. This can be very dangerous. You can easily make
      sure that you will not forget your helmet when you just store it on top of
      the wakeboard during breaks.
