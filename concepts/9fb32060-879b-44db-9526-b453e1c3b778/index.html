    Given that a beginner asks you what he should pay attention due during a
    start with wakeboard or waterskiis <b>regarding his driving direction</b>,
    what could be reasonable advice?
  </div>
  <div slot="answer">
    For beginners, it might be advisable to just focus on keeping stability
    during the start and not steering in any direction. The rope will
