        Components are the visual units that make up your application. Small
        components are composed to bigger components to form a whole page.
        Components are self-contained and take care of their HTML structure,
        styling and <i>internal</i> logic.

        Services are suitable for <i>any</i> functionality that you would like
        to share. You can specify where it is provided <i>globally</i> as a
        singleton (very common) or in a specific context (advanced, explained
        <a
          href="https://angular.io/guide/architecture-services#providing-services"
          >here</a
        >). Then you can just inject it where you need it.

        Pipes let you <i>conveniently</i> perform data transformations right in
        your HTML templates. Note that they are mostly syntactic sugar. But if
        you set their <code>pure</code> flag to <code>true</code>, it has the
        additional performance advantage of memorization which means that it
        will only recalculate when the input changes.
      </cw-element>
      <cw-element cw-title="Modules" cw-optional>
        A user will usually use parts of your application. To improve
        performance, his browser should only the parts it needs. Therefore, it
        is advantageous to split your parts into separate modules that can be
        loaded separately.
        <cw-personal-note>
          With the introduction of
          <a href="https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components"
            >standalone components</a
          >, modules became optional as each standalone component can define its
          dependencies by itself. In my opinion, this is an easier and more
          granular approach with less boilerplate. I guess it makes sense to
          move away from modules completely if possible as they offer no
          significant advantage. It is already possible to build a complete
          Angular application with routing completely without modules as shown
