    What should you be aware of when falling into the water?

  <cw-item id="approachingRiders">
    <h6>Watch approaching riders</h6>
    <p>
      You should see whether oncoming riders clearly see you and are able to
      drive around you with a safe distance. If a rider seems to accidentally
      ride directly towards you, you might be able to prevent injuries by putting
      your head below water and covering it with your arms.
    </p>
  </cw-item>

  <cw-item id="approachingHandles">
    <h6>Watch approaching handles</h6>
    <p>
      When you cannot avoid an approaching handle, you should put your head
      underwater. This can safely prevent the handle from damaging your face -
      especially your nose.
    </p>
  </cw-item>

  <cw-item id="stayVisible">
    <h6>Only swim where you are clearly visible to approaching drivers</h6>
    <p>
      Swimming behind obstacles can lead to others not seeing you and
      unsuspectingly driving over the obstacle - leaving them potentially not
      enough time to avoid driving into you.
    </p>
  </cw-item>

  <cw-item id="leaveWaterFast">
    <h6>Leave the water fast</h6>
    <p>
      This rule is especially important in the starting area because other
      riders might potentially have to wait for the starting area to clear.
