    Suppose you are driving directly towards a person swimming in the water and
    you are unable to drive around him? What must you remember?

  <div slot="answer">
    <p>
      In those situations you must
      <b>let go of the handle immediately and lean to either side</b> in order
      to fall into the water immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people tend to freeze and grip the handle very firmly which can lead
