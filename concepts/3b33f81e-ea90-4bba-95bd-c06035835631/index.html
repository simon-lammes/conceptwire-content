    What are important properties of your starting position when doing
    waterskii?

  <cw-item id="lowPosition">
    <h6>Low position</h6>
    <p>
      The lower you are, the more stable and less likely you are to fall to
      either side. You can even stay in low position after a successful start
      until you feel safe getting into a more upright postion.
    </p>

  <cw-item id="centeredPosition">
    <h6>Centered Position (not leaning to either side)</h6>
    <p>Leaning forwards or backwards can come with decreased stability.</p>
  </cw-item>
  <cw-item id="armsStretched">
    <h6>Arms stretched forward</h6>
    <p>
      Even though having arms bent a little to get some flexibility is usually
      okay, for beginners it might be easier and more comfortable to just have
      the stretched the whole time. It is one less aspect to think about.

  <cw-item id="coreEngaged">
    <h6>Core engaged</h6>
    <p>
      When your core is engaged, you are better prepared for the abrupt force
      that is about to impact you.
