        Suppose a colleague comes to you with the following question:
        <blockquote>
          My app has this search bar where users can search items from the
          database. It works fine like this: Whenever the search bar value
          changes, we send a query to our backend and show the results to the
          user. However, it seems inefficient to me because while the user types
          his search term there occurs a `valueChanged` event for every
          keystroke and a corresponding query is executed. Wouldn't it be more
          efficient to only send a query once the user does not type anymore for
          about half a second? What should I google to find out how to do it?

          This behavior is commonly referred to as
          <cw-external-reference
            cw-href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/debouncing"

        </cw-short-answer>
        Depending on your tech steck you can use different tool for debouncing,
        but for example, RxJS has a very nice
        <cw-external-reference
          cw-href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/learn-rxjs/operators/filtering/debouncetime"
          >debounceTime</cw-external-reference
        >
        operator for debouncing a given observable with a configurable time.
