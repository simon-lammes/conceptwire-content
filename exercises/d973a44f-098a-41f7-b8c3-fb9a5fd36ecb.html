        What is the problem with the following code?
      </cw-instructions>
      <cw-info>
        You are looking at a component that should greet a list of people. It
        uses the imaginary <code>add-person-form</code> component in which the
        user can add new people to be greeted. When the user creates a new
        person, the <code>personAdded</code> event emitter emits that person's
        name.

        The reference to <code>this.people</code> is not changed which leads to
        Angular not updating the UI.
      </cw-short-answer>
      When a person is added, the people array is modified, but its reference
      stays the same. Angular will compare the old <code>this.people</code> with
      the new <code>this.people</code> during change detection. Since it is
      simple reference comparison, Angular will think that it has not changed
      and will not update the component. It is one of those bugs where you would
      ask yourself why the website is not properly updating.

      <p style="margin-top: 8px">
        Instead, the people's array should be reassigned with a modified copy of
        the previous array. This can be easily done with JavaScript's spread
        syntax.
        <!-- prettier-ignore -->
        <cw-code>
addPerson(person: string) {
  this.people = [...this.people, person];
}
      </cw-code>
