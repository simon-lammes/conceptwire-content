      <div slot="question">
        Say you have some data that you need to transform in a somewhat complex
        way before rendering it as HTML. Where could you put that logic? Which
        options do you have and what are their advantages?
        <cw-example>
          For example, you might have a list of names that you want to display
          in a list. But you want every letter that appears at least twice
          within a given name to be colored green. Therefore, you would first
          need to determine those letters somewhere.
        </cw-example>

      <cw-opinion cw-title="Component">
        <cw-short-answer>
          A component usually has the advantage of being very <b>scoped</b>,
          meaning that it only affects itself and it's relatives but not the
          whole application.
        </cw-short-answer>
        One suggestion would be to always put logic within a component when it
        is only needed for that component and nowhere else. This has the
        advantage that is very easy to reason about: When you want to find out
        about a components behavior, you just have a look at that component and
        do not have to look at a thousand different places that your component's
        logic is scattered about. I haven't found a name for the principle, but
        I feel like it is generally agreed upon that we prefer "local state over
        global state" and we prefer "local functionally over global
        functionality if it is only needed locally".

      <cw-opinion cw-title="Pipe">
        <cw-short-answer>
          A pipe usually has the advantage of being <b>re-usable</b> and
          <b>syntactically</b> elegant.
        </cw-short-answer>
        If you want to re-use that transformation logic across multiple places,
        and you are able to put it in a pipe that is easy to use, then pipes are
        a very elegant solution. But when your pipe has complex data types and
        inputs, it <em>might</em> become cumbersome because dealing with complex
        data types in your HTML templates - where pipes are used - can get ugly.
      </cw-opinion>
      <cw-opinion cw-title="Service">
        <cw-short-answer>
          A service usually has the advantage of being <b>re-usable</b> and
          <b>easily-accessible</b> through dependency injection.
        </cw-short-answer>
        Although pipes and services are usually very different, in this example
        they are somewhat similar. They both offer
        <b>globally accessible</b> data transformation logic. One difference is
        that a service can be used in your TypeScript files more easily because
        it usually can just be injected into your component. This is because
        services are provided globally (in 'root') by default. A pipe needs to
        be manually provided in order to inject it.
