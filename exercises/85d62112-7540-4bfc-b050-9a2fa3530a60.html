      <div slot="question">
        In my Angular application, I have this nice box component and on
        different pages I would like to put different content into that box. For
        example, on the pizza page, I would like to put pizza images inside. But
        I want to build the component in a flexible way so that I could put
        <em>anything</em> inside it. For which term should I look on the
        internet to find out how it works in Angular?

          Angular refers to this concept as
          <cw-external-reference
            cw-href="https://angular.io/guide/content-projection"
            ><b>Content Projection</b></cw-external-reference
          >.
        </cw-short-answer>
        <div>
          In fact, this example calls for most simple form of content
          projection: single-slot content projection. In that case, a component
          just offers one place (aka. slot) that content can be projected to.
